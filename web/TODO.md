# TODO

- [ ] prefs dialog is unreadable
- [ ] "about" dialog doesn't work on firefox mobile beta
- [ ] progressbars are difficult to understand in dark mode -- fully downloaded paused _looks_ like not downloaded
- [ ] clicking on the toolbar should dismiss the context menu
- [ ] selecting a torrent by right-clicking on it -- the popup doesn't get the updated action_manager states
- [ ] consider refactoring inspector tabs to be reusable code
- [ ] selecting torrents accidentally highlights the torrent rows' texts
- [ ] remove old torrent class
- [ ] inspector is goofy
  - [ ] activity page needs margin fixing between sections
  - [ ] consider _not_ treating inspector like a popup on desktop -- specifically, don't dismiss it when clicking on torrent list
  - [ ] should fill screen in mobile mode
- [ ] can't activate the filter text on mobile
- [ ] should there be a maximum width for the app? it looks kind of bad on a desktop when the window is wide
- [ ] filterbar isn't responsive
  - [ ] shorten width of input field
- [ ] change the highlight color in dark mode
