# TODO

- [ ] "about" dialog doesn't work on firefox mobile beta
- [ ] inspector is goofy
  - [ ] tier list looks wrong on mobile
  - [ ] peers list looks awful
  - [ ] no webseeds on peer list
  - [ ] activity page needs margin fixing between sections
  - [ ] consider _not_ treating inspector like a popup on desktop -- specifically, don't dismiss it when clicking on torrent list
- [ ] filterbar isn't responsive
  - [ ] shorten width of input field
- [ ] maybe hide focus border on tab buttons? it looks bad on dark mode mobile
- [ ] should there be a maximum width for the app? it looks kind of bad on a desktop when the window is wide
