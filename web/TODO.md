# TODO

- [ ] one unified stylesheet

- [ ] decide on a single mobile-and-desktop friendly apparance of Inspector

- [ ] remove jQuery
  - [ ] remove use of jquery-ui-tabs from prefs dialog

## Short-term TODO
- [x] compact mode is broken
- [x] overlaid progressbars are broken
- [x] dialogs are broken in smol mode
- [x] buttons in 'remove' dialog are wrong
- [x] entry field in 'rename' dialog isn't wide enough
- [x] entry field in 'set location' dialog isn't wide enough
- [x] buttons in 'set location' dialog are wrong
- [x] dialogs that appear to be using jquery-ui but could use the dialog refactor:
  - [x] 'about'
  - [x] 'shortcuts'
  - [x] 'stats'
- [x] 'paused' class is not set on the torrent-name items when the torrent is paused
- [x] torrent-row pause/resume buttons don't highlight
- [x] replace png files with svgs where possible
- [x] extract the configs out of package.json -- preferably into .js files where comments can be used
- [x] ratio should have one decimal place, not two
- [x] can't open the 'about' dialog after opening and closing the 'remove' dialog
- [x] 'open' shortcut 'o' only works once
- [x] compact mode overflows on iPhone
- [x] more menu
  - [x] more menu should 'slide' out from left
  - [x] figure out what to do on submenus
  - [x] styling
  - [x] scrolling on mobile?
  - [x] wire in start all
  - [x] wire in stop all
  - [x] wire in homepage
  - [x] wire in tip jar
  - [x] should OVERLAY torrent container, not go before it
- [x] what to do about context menu? it still uses jQuery
- [x] clicking the torrent area should hide popups
- [x] on mobile, context menu always goes up
- [x] add fullscreen mode
  - [x] remove the last of the 'hide addressbar' code
  - [x] maybe remove the fullscreen hotkey -- it's only useful on mobile, and few keyboards there
  - [x] should we hide the fullscreen button on desktop?
- [ ] on mobile, torrent list, prefs, and inspector should take turns filling the workarea -- prefs/inspector are not popups on mobile
- [ ] on desktop, torrent list is alway the primary in the workarea. prefs/inspector should go on the rhs
- [ ] inspector is goofy
  - [x] background is transparent
  - [x] file list still uses jQuery
  - [x] file list alignment doesn't line up right
  - [ ] activity page needs margin fixing between sections
  - [ ] consider _not_ treating inspector like a popup on desktop -- specifically, don't dismiss it when clicking on torrent list
  - [ ] should fill screen in mobile mode
- [ ] context menu doesn't like area where there are no rows
- [ ] stats dialog looks bad on mobile
- [ ] can't activate the filter text on mobile
- [ ] should there be a maximum width for the app? it looks kind of bad on a desktop when the window is wide
- [ ] filterbar isn't responsive
  - [ ] shorten width of input field
- [ ] what to do about prefs dialog? it still uses jQuery
- [ ] what to do about footer? it's not useful right now
  - [ ] move speed up/down from filterbar to footer
- [ ] aria for sidebar menu
  - [ ] https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices/examples/checkbox/checkbox-1/checkbox-1.html
    - [ ] tabindex
    - [ ] aria-checked='false'
    - [ ] aria-checked='true'
    - [ ] :focus
    - [ ] data-command
box
- [ ] change the highlight color in dark mode
- [ ] hide addressbar
